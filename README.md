# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Sara and currently I'm a new coder who is interested in topics such as AI and optimization.  I can't wait to work create and also collaborate on some exciting, challenging projects with my fellow gitters!  Learning is a lifelong journey and I believe that it is vital to strive to improve ourselves as well as our knowledge base.  

Aside from coding, I love playing board games, going to group water aerobic classes, and traveling the world! Oh, did I mention how much I love food?! Simply put, food is life and I am definitely living it.
